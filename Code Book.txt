This document describes a tidy dataset produced by cleaning and summarizing data download from UCI’s “Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set”. The original data set contains a series of measurements of 30 different subjects performing any one of six different activities while wearing a cell phone.  Details of the original data set can be found at this link:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
In addition to sampled movement data, the original data set contains means and standard deviation of different types of movements across the X, Y and Z axes. The tidy data set submitted with this document contains averages of the original mean and standard deviation, grouped by subject then activity.
The original data set describes measurements of acceleration and velocity that were normalized between the values of -1 and 1.
The tidy data set contains values for 81 different variables out of the original 561. These variables are organized in a wide data set with 4 columns and 180 rows (30 Subjects x 6 activities). Each row has 81 variables as described below.
Data Dictionary
IDs:
Activity
- Descriptive name of each of the activities (Factor six different values)
- WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
Subject ID
- Factor with 30 different values representing each of the different unique subjects
- 1,2,3, . . . 30
Measurements - averages of values for each possible combination of the above IDs for means and standard deviations in the original data set. All measurements are numeric with values between -1 and 1:
